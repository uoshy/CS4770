    <h2>Software Architecture</h2>
    <p>Notes about design:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There are two main, mostly decoupled, features of this system. There is the assignment and grading system which encompasses intructors, students, courses, etc. There is also the cloud-based code compiling and execution system. On the server these systems are quite decoupled but the client-side user interface will create the impression of a unified system.</li>
        <li>The Spark Java server framework uses a thread pool so every request is already handeled on separate threads. Therefore we do not have to worry overly about the amount of work done during each HTTP request.</li>
        <li>The Spark Java server framework can also serve static files very nicely and so we will use that, along with a backing UNIX file system to store all the user's files.</li>
        <li>To maintain an open connection between the client web browser and possible console applications running on the server we will launch all processes in new threads and store them in a singelton process manager called Console. These process threads will persist between HTTP requests and can be interacted with using polling AJAX requests.</li>
    </ul>
