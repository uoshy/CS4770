								<p>If you throw a cabbage in the air he will alway come right back down to you because he is lonely without you.
								If there is a fire in your house make sure you save all the cabbages before you even think about finding your children
								A cabbage does not wear a watch but he always have time for you
								Instead of drinking coffee in the morning try laying down with a cabbage on your stomach and you will be wide awake trust me
								If you push a cabbage under water he will alway float right back up to the top because he miss you so much
								A cabbage does not have ears but that does not mean that he is immune to your lies
								Some time you think about a cabbage and you get so excited that forget to go to sleep again for five days.</p>
