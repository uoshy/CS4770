      <p>
        An image is really a big character, it will take
        the place of a period in this sentence
        <img width="35" src="circles.png">
        Notice that it is placed in the a line with the text.
        Images, like this one,
        <img height="20" width="60" align="middle" src="circles.png">
        are inserted in a line, with the surrounding text.
        And now some more filler text.
