    <h1>Work Plan</h1>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>The first two weeks are very heavy on anaylsis and design. Once a design is thought through well it will more easily transition to implementation. It is important for design to be thoughtful before implementation begins.</p>
    <p>Once implementation begins the features are sorted so that something that is depended on is completed first. The feautres are also sorted so that those that have the most risk associated with them (i.e. there is some speculation on how to properly implement) are completed early in the project to reduce the risk of project failure. The last two weeks of the project are left solely for polish and review. In almost all projects it is guaranteed to experience delay and overrun in feature estimates. This buffer will account for that and allow time for through testing and bug fixing.</p>
